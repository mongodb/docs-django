Overview
--------

On this page, you can find information about supported and unsupported
features in {+django-odm+}. You can also find features
currently planned for the General Availability (GA) and post-GA
releases. We will prioritize these upcoming features
based on user demand, and you can request support
for a feature by :ref:`creating a JIRA issue <django-issues-and-help>`.

MongoDB Features
----------------

This section indicates whether the {+django-odm+} supports various
MongoDB features and which features we plan to support in
the GA release.

Index Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * - MongoDB Feature
     - Public Preview Support
     - General Availability Support

   * - Atlas Search and Atlas Vector Search indexes
     - *Partially Supported*. You cannot use the Django
       Indexes API to create these indexes, but you can use
       the PyMongo Driver by :ref:`exposing your MongoClient <django-client-operations>`.
     - ✓

   * - Geospatial indexes
     - *Partially Supported*. You cannot use the Django
       Indexes API to create these indexes, but you can use
       the PyMongo Driver by :ref:`exposing your MongoClient <django-client-operations>`.
     - ✓

   * - Updating ``EmbeddedModelFields`` indexes after model creation
     - *Unsupported*
     - ✓

Field Type Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30 40

   * - MongoDB Field Type
     - Public Preview Support
     - General Availability Support

   * - ``Array``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use the ``ArrayField`` field type with the
       following limitations:

       - ``ArrayField`` polymorphism is not supported.
       -  Nested ``EmbeddedModelField`` values within an ``ArrayField`` are not supported.

     - ✓

   * - ``Object``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use the ``EmbeddedModelField`` field type with the
       following limitations:

       - ``EmbeddedModel`` schema changes do not register after creation.
       - Embedded documents cannot take Django foreign keys.
       - Arbitrary or untyped embedded model fields are not supported. You must
         derive all fields from a ``EmbeddedModel`` class.
       
     - *Partial Support Planned*. We plan to add support for registering 
       ``EmbeddedModel`` schema changes after creation.

{+django-odm+} currently supports all other MongoDB field types not included
in the preceding table. To view a full list of supported fields, see the :ref:`django-models-mongodb-fields`

     - *Full Support Not Planned*. However, we plan to add support for MongoDB
       aggregation operators in a post-GA release.

   * - Atlas Search queries

Django Features
---------------

This section indicates whether the {+django-odm+} supports various
{+framework+} features and which features we plan to support in
the GA release.

Field Type Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30 40

   * - {+framework+} Field Type
     - Public Preview Support
     - General Availability Support

   * - ``AutoField``
     - *Unsupported*. The ``BigAutoField`` and ``SmallAutoField`` types are also
       not supported. Instead, use ``ObjectIdField``.
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``BSONRegExp``
     - *Unsupported*.
     - *Unsupported*. However, we plan to support this field
       in a post-GA release.

   * - ``DateTimeField``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - Microsecond granularity for ``DateTimeField`` values is not supported.
       
     - *Full Support Not Planned*.

   * - ``DurationField``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - ``DurationField`` stores milliseconds rather than microseconds
       
     - *Full Support Not Planned*.

   * - ``ForeignKey``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - When possible, you should use an ``EmbeddedModelField`` instead of a
         ``ForeignKey`` field to avoid using ``$lookup`` operations. An
         ``EmbeddedModelField`` emulates a MongoDB embedded document and performs
         better than a ``ForeignKey`` field. To learn more about how to reduce
         ``$lookup`` operations, see the :atlas:`Reduce $lookup Operations
         </schema-suggestions/reduce-lookup-operations/>` guide in the Atlas
         documentation.
       - Performance of `CASCADE deletes <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CASCADE>`__
         on a ``ForeignKey`` field is not as performant as using an
         ``EmbeddedModelField``.
       
     - *Full Support Not Planned*.

   * - ``GeneratedField``
     - *Unsupported*.
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``JSONField``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - {+django-odm+} cannot distinguish between a JSON and a SQL ``null`` value.
         Queries that use ``Value(None, JSONField())`` or the ``isnull`` lookup
         return both JSON and SQL ``null`` values.
       - Some queries with ``Q`` objects, such as ``Q(value__foo="bar")``, might
         not work as expected.
       - Filtering for ``None`` values incorrectly returns objects in which a field
         does not exist.

     - *Full Support Not Planned*. However, we plan to address the
       ``Q`` object and ``None`` key filtering limitations in a post-GA release.

{+django-odm+} currently supports all other {+framework+} field types not included in
the preceding table. To view a full list of supported fields, see the :ref:`django-models-django-fields`
section of the Create Models guide.
