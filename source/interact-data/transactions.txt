Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+django-odm+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to perform a series of operations
that change data only if the entire transaction is committed.
If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the library stops the
transaction and discards all data changes before they ever become
visible. This feature is called **atomicity**.
